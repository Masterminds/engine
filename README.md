# The Engine: A Theme/Template Library for Go

This library provides tools for managing themes (a collection of
templates and supporting files) for Go. It allows theme chaining
and overriding.

This library is oriented toward Web theming using `html/template`
and `text/template`.

With this library, you can:

- Support numerous themes in one app
- Cascade and override themes
- Provide easy support for re-theming an existing app
